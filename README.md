My final project for UCI's cyber bootcamp.
In this project you will find the creation of a simple Splunk alert from a simulated brute force attack.
PLEASE NOTE!! The video will not play in the powerpoint because it is a PDF, please download it from the coorelated page within this repo to view it. I am sorry for the inconvenience.
